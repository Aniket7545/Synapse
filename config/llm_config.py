Based on the damage/dispute scenario described:

Analysis: This appears to be a package integrity issue requiring evidence-based resolution.

Recommended Strategy:
1. Immediate mediation between customer and driver
2. Collect photographic evidence from both parties  
3. AI analysis of evidence to determine fault
4. Process appropriate compensation if merchant fault detected
5. Clear driver if evidence supports their handling
6. Provide feedback to merchant for packaging improvements

Expected Outcome: Fair, evidence-based resolution maintaining customer satisfaction while protecting driver livelihood.

Analysis: Customer experiencing delivery timeline expectations mismatch.

Recommended Strategy:
1. Proactive communication with delay explanation and new ETA

5. Premium customer priority handling if applicable

Expected Outcome: Customer satisfaction maintained through transparency and compensation.
