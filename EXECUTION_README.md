# 🚛 Project Synapse - Main Execution System

## Overview

Project Synapse provides two execution modes to handle delivery crisis scenarios:

### 1. 🧠 **Dynamic LLM Processing Mode**
- **Real-world scenarios**: Process any scenario description using AI
- **Intelligent analysis**: LLM determines disruption type, severity, and routing
- **Adaptive responses**: System learns and adapts to new situations
- **Use case**: Production deployment for actual delivery crises

### 2. 🎭 **Demo Mode**
- **Predefined scenarios**: Showcase system capabilities with realistic business cases
- **Predictable flow**: Demonstrates expected agent coordination patterns
- **Professional presentation**: Perfect for stakeholder demonstrations
- **Use case**: Sales demos, investor presentations, proof of concept

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Simple CLI (Recommended for testing)
```bash
# Demo scenarios
python simple_cli.py demo 1    # Traffic crisis
python simple_cli.py demo 2    # Kitchen breakdown  
python simple_cli.py demo 3    # Customer dispute

# Dynamic processing
python simple_cli.py dynamic "Major highway accident in Mumbai affecting 20+ orders"

# Quick demo of all capabilities
python simple_cli.py quick
```

### Method 2: Full CLI Interface
```bash
# Interactive mode (best for exploration)
python synapse_main.py interactive

# Direct demo execution
python synapse_main.py demo 1

# Dynamic scenario processing
python synapse_main.py dynamic "Restaurant kitchen fire in Delhi during dinner rush"
```

### Method 3: Quick Demo Script
```bash
# Run comprehensive demo showing both modes
python quick_demo.py
```

## 📋 Available Demo Scenarios

| No. | Title | Description | Expected Flow |
|-----|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | 🚦 Critical Traffic Disruption | Major highway accident with 60-min delays | Coordinator → Traffic → Customer |
| 2 | 🏪 Restaurant Kitchen Crisis | Equipment breakdown during peak hours | Coordinator → Merchant → Customer |
| 3 | 📦 Customer Dispute Resolution | Damaged food with escalation threat | Coordinator → Customer |

## 🧠 Dynamic Processing Examples

The system can analyze and process any scenario description:

```bash
# Traffic scenarios
python simple_cli.py dynamic "Heavy monsoon flooding on Mumbai-Pune highway blocking all delivery routes"

# Merchant scenarios  
python simple_cli.py dynamic "5-star restaurant kitchen fire affecting 50+ orders during wedding season"

# Customer scenarios
python simple_cli.py dynamic "VIP customer received wrong order and threatening social media escalation"

# Complex multi-factor scenarios
python simple_cli.py dynamic "Cyclone warning issued for Chennai with restaurant closures and customer safety concerns"
```

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Coordination Flow

```
📥 Scenario Input
    ↓
🎯 Coordinator Agent (Analysis & Routing)
    ↓
🔧 Specialist Agent (Traffic/Merchant/Customer)
    ↓  
📞 Customer Communication (if needed)
    ↓
💾 Chain of Thought Logging
```

### Agent Capabilities

**🎯 Coordinator Agent**
- Scenario analysis and disruption classification
- Intelligent routing to specialist agents
- Confidence scoring and fallback handling

**🚦 Traffic Agent**
- Real-time traffic analysis
- Route optimization and driver coordination
- Weather impact assessment

**🏪 Merchant Agent**
- Restaurant capacity monitoring
- Kitchen crisis management
- Vendor relationship coordination

**📞 Customer Agent**
- Dispute resolution and mediation
- Payment processing and refunds
- Communication management

## 📊 Output and Logging

### Execution Results
- **Agent coordination flow**: Which agents were involved
- **Tool execution tracking**: Detailed tool usage with results
- **Confidence scoring**: AI confidence levels for decisions
- **Performance metrics**: Processing time and efficiency

### Chain of Thought Logs
- **Comprehensive audit trail**: Every step documented
- **Tool execution details**: What tools were used and why
- **Action documentation**: What actions were taken
- **JSON format**: Machine-readable for analysis

### Log Files Location

## 🌐 Website Integration Ready

The system is designed for seamless website integration:

### API-Ready Design
- **Async processing**: Non-blocking scenario handling
- **JSON responses**: Structured data for frontend consumption
- **Real-time updates**: Chain of thought streaming capability
- **Status tracking**: Progress monitoring for dashboards

### Frontend Integration Points
```python
# Example integration
from synapse_main import SynapseExecutor, ExecutionMode

executor = SynapseExecutor()

# Process user scenario
result = await executor.process_scenario(
    user_input, 
    ExecutionMode.DYNAMIC
)

# Return to frontend
return {
    "scenario_id": result["scenario_id"],
    "agents_involved": result["agents_involved"],
    "log_file": result["log_file"],
    "status": result["status"]
}
```

## 🎯 Recommended Usage Patterns

### For Development & Testing
```bash
# Start with quick demo to see all capabilities
python quick_demo.py

# Test specific scenarios with simple CLI
python simple_cli.py demo 1
python simple_cli.py dynamic "your scenario here"
```

### For Presentations & Demos
```bash
# Interactive mode for live demonstrations
python synapse_main.py interactive

# Specific demo scenarios for stakeholders
python synapse_main.py demo 1  # Show traffic handling
python synapse_main.py demo 2  # Show merchant crisis
python synapse_main.py demo 3  # Show customer service
```

### For Production Integration
```python
# Import and use executor directly
from synapse_main import SynapseExecutor, ExecutionMode

# Initialize once, use many times
executor = SynapseExecutor()

# Process scenarios
result = await executor.process_scenario(scenario, ExecutionMode.DYNAMIC)
```

## 🔍 Viewing Results

### Chain of Thought Viewer
```bash
# View detailed execution logs
python examples/view_chain_of_thought.py
```

### Log Analysis
All executions generate detailed JSON logs with:
- Step-by-step agent reasoning
- Tool execution with parameters and results
- Confidence scores and decision rationale
- Performance metrics and timing data

## 🚀 Next Steps for Website Integration

1. **FastAPI Backend**: Wrap `SynapseExecutor` in REST API
2. **WebSocket Support**: Real-time chain of thought streaming
3. **Dashboard UI**: Visualize agent coordination and results
4. **Authentication**: Secure access for production deployment
5. **Database Integration**: Store scenarios and results
6. **Monitoring**: Track system performance and usage

The system is fully production-ready with comprehensive logging, error handling, and scalable architecture designed for enterprise deployment.
