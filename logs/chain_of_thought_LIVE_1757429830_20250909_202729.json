      "reasoning": "**ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe scenario indicates a critical issue with order prep time exceeding 40 minutes, resulting in unacceptable delays. This situation affects not only the restaurant's reputation but also the merchant's customer satisfaction and loyalty. The root cause of this issue likely lies in the restaurant's operational inefficiencies, inadequate staffing, or supply chain disruptions.\n\n**Affected Parties:**\n\n1. **Merchant**: The customer who placed the order and is experiencing delays.\n2. **Restaurant**: The establishment responsible for preparing and delivering the order.\n3. **Merchant Agent**: The specialist responsible for resolving the issue and ensuring customer satisfaction.\n4. **Restaurant Operations**: The team responsible for managing the kitchen, staff, and supply chain.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n\nThe root cause of this issue can be attributed to a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. **Operational Inefficiencies**: Inadequate staffing, poor kitchen layout, or inefficient workflow processes.\n2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Delays or shortages in ingredient delivery, affecting menu item availability.\n3. **Lack of Communication**: Inadequate communication between restaurant staff, kitchen, and delivery teams.\n\n**ACTION_PLAN:**\n\nTo address this crisis, I recommend the following specific action steps:\n\n1. **Initiate Real-Time Mediation** (Step 1): Engage with the restaurant operations team to understand the root cause of the delay and negotiate a revised delivery time.\n2. **Guide Evidence Collection** (Step 2): Collaborate with the restaurant to gather evidence of the delay, including photos, videos, or witness statements, to support the mediation process.\n3. **Deploy Smart Resolution** (Step 3): Work with the restaurant to implement a temporary solution to mitigate the delay, such as prioritizing the order or allocating additional staff.\n4. **Execute Instant Compensation** (Step 4): Offer a suitable compensation to the merchant, such as a discount or free item, to make up for the delay and maintain customer satisfaction.\n\n**APPROACH:**\n\nMy systematic resolution methodology involves a structured approach to crisis management, which includes:\n\n1. **Assessment**: Identify the root cause of the issue and affected parties.\n2. **Analysis**: Gather evidence and data to support the mediation process.\n3. **Negotiation**: Engage with the restaurant operations team to negotiate a revised delivery time and temporary solution.\n4. **Implementation**: Deploy the temporary solution and execute instant compensation.\n5. **Review**: Review the outcome and adjust the approach as necessary.\n\n**URGENCY:** Critical\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 0.9\n\nExpected outcomes:\n\n* Revised delivery time within 30 minutes\n* Merchant satisfaction rating improved by 20%\n* Restaurant operations team implements temporary solution to mitigate delays\n* Merchant receives suitable compensation for the delay\n\nBy following this action plan and systematic resolution methodology, we can effectively address the crisis, maintain customer satisfaction, and prevent future occurrences.",
