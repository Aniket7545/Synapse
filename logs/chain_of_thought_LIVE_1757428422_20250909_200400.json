The customer_agent can communicate with the customer, verify the order status, and provide a resolution (e.g., refund, reshipment, or compensation). While the traffic_agent and merchant_agent may be involved in specific aspects of the issue, the customer_agent is the primary point of contact for the customer and is best equipped to handle the initial communication and resolution efforts.",
